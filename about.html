                    <p>
                        Izy Hicks is an elite adaptive snowboarder whose drive and resilience have made her a rising
                        force on the international stage. Born without her right hand, Izy embraced snowboarding as an
                        opportunity to adapt, and as a way to challenge her own and others’ perceptions of what’s
                        possible. Her journey has been shaped by overcoming insecurity, fear, and injury—experiences
                        that have forged her mental toughness and commitment to self-growth.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Izy competes in boardercross and banked slalom on the continental and world cup circuits.
                        Since stepping onto the competitive scene, Izy has earned multiple podium finishes, including
                        first place at the 2019, and 2024 Para NorAm in Big White, and a 1st place win at the 2024
                        Europa Cup in Pyhä, Finland, and tying for a Crystal globe after her debut on the world cup SBX
                        circuit at Steamboat Springs in 2025. Off the slopes, she is a public speaker who motivates
                        others to embrace challenges and chase progress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Izy’s philosophy is simple: turn obstacles into opportunities, and fear into fuel. Whether on the
                        race course or serving her community, she leads with authenticity, grit, and a reminder that the
                        limits we see are often the ones we set for ourselves.
